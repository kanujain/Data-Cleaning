# Data-Cleaning

The main aim of Data Cleaning is to identify and remove errors & duplicate data, in order to create a reliable dataset. This improves the quality of the training data for analytics and enables accurate decision-making.

Data cleaning is a critically important step in any machine learning project.

In tabular data, there are many different statistical analysis and data visualization techniques you can use to explore your data in order to identify data cleaning operations you may want to perform.

Before jumping to the sophisticated methods, there are some very basic data cleaning operations that you probably should perform on every single machine learning project. These are so basic that they are often overlooked by seasoned machine learning practitioners, yet are so critical that if skipped, models may break or report overly optimistic performance results.
